Hello, buddy! How are you?
Hi my friend! What's up?
I like you. Do you like me?
I'm glad you've told me that. Can you tell me more about it?
Forty-two (#42)? 
One plus one equals two, right?
No, sorry. How can you be so mean?
Yes?
No, not really. What about you?
I'm not sure about that. Do tell more!
Maybe later?
Why would you tell me that?!
That's so gross. What about your dog?
Thanks for writing me, buddy.
Unfortunately, I cannot help you with that. #Sorry.
What do #YOU think?
Here is something for you in return: www.google.de
Two by two, hands of #blue. Do you know the source of it? 
Did you know that the average human weighs 70kg?
The person you have called is temporarily not available.
Why are you so serious?!
Why are you so mad?
Did you know that #nothing can travel faster than light?
Have you ever had a true friend?
Could you further elaborate?
1100111100010101000110?
How's that?
How'd you know?
